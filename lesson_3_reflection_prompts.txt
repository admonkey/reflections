1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working from different machines in different locations and with other people.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe I don't want to pull changes from someone else, or I would rather be at least proactive in examining changes.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones are copies of repos. Forks are clones that are exclusive to GitHub on order to enhance version tracking. Branches begin local, usually as experimental features.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can work offline to merge changes.
