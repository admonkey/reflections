1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working from different machines in different locations and with other people.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe I don't want to pull changes from someone else, or I would rather be at least proactive in examining changes.
