1)  How did using Diff make you feel?
It was helpful.

2)  How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It might be helpful to analyze my own patterns of development, and to spot where mistakes began awry.

3)  What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
cons are that I might forget to commit. pros are that I can intelligently select the best logical breaks.

4)  Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Probably because those other services are not tuned for coding, to whereas multiple interdependent files are commonplace in software development.

5)  How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log shows the whole history. once you see the comments of the versions of interest, then compare them with git diff.

6)  How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It's like I could go back at any time and checkout a working version of code.

7)  Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use Git so that I can effectively work in programming teams.
